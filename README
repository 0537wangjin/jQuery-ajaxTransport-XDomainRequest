Implements automatic CORS support using the XDomainRequest object for IE8 and IE9 when using jQuery 1.5+ ajax function.

CORS requires the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to be present in the AJAX response.

Working example here:

Note:
XDomainRequest must be: asynchronous, GET or POST methods, HTTP or HTTPS protocol, and same scheme as calling page
